# This is a dirty and shameful workaround to get around the requirement for having
# Source tag poiting to the url with archived source code. Since in Jenkins we have the sources available
# and, what is even worse, the sources being built are not available in any kind of repository,
# we can't put anything meaningful in here. So the workaround consists in pointing to an empty tarball,
# which gets extracted without any effect.
